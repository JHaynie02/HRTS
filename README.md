## A Human Resource Tracking System

The Human Resource Tracking System can save your bussiness money by giving your human resource manager more efficient tools in hiring new employees, viewing and
editing employees information. No longer will you need to store old applications and employee info on paper when this program does that for you. Here is a list 
of all things this program can do.

### Applications
- Create and submit a new application for anyone wanting to fill out a job application.
- Have the program automatically sift through bad applications so the manager does not have to.
- What the program deems a bad application:    (Anyone one of these listed below and the application is deemed no good)
    1) A convicted felon
    2) Did not graduate highschool
    3) No prior work experience
    4) The current position being applied for has no openings
- View an entire history of all applications ever submitted with times of when that application was submitted
- View all current good applications and either hire that person or get rid of that application
- Viewing good applications will always be sorted in the order the application was submitted
- View good applications based off what position that person is applying for
